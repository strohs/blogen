Blogen
====================================================================================================================
A multi-page admin UI for a fictional Blog site: "Blogen". This is the front-end only. The site is not attached to a
 real back-end.

## Development Info
This site is part of my coursework for [Bootstrap 4 from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com) taught by
 [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com). It mainly uses bootstrap 4 features along with SASS.
This was developed using Intellij Idea 2017.3 along with nodejs (8.7.3 LTS) and gulp.

## Running
The main index.html is in the ```src``` directory. As long as you keep the directory structure intact you should be
able to navigate the pages. If you have node/npm installed you should just run ```npm start``` to kick off the
development server and load the main index.html page.
